I absolutely hate battery icons. I find they don't give useful information in comparison to battery percentages. It's so hard to tell exactly how much longer until I NEED to plug in the device. It drives me crazy that basically all the devices I use have the option to hide the battery percentages but not the icon. IOS, macOS, Android, Linux (sorta), and Windows. 


Immediately after getting the steam deck, I wanted to hide the battery icon but found no option to do so. Shortly after I found out about decky loaders and CSS loaders, I tried to find a theme to remove the battery icon, but I was not able to find one. I then forgot about it. A few months later, I revisited the idea, and once again, I was not able to find a theme. Fine, I will make my own.

It took me about 5 minutes to set up remote debugging on the Steam Deck. Once I had remote debugging enabled, it did not take long to make the theme. The longest part was making the theme.json file required by Decky Themes. With the reach it has gotten, 26000 downloads and 80 stars and the little effort it took to make it, I am surprised no one had done it before me.
