Originally created in 2020 by [Anish](https://anishdoes.dev) & Mozza to track Discord bot statistics, such as guild count, user count, cpu usage, etc. Around August of 2022 Statcord showed signs of issues such as taking a long time to load, loading incomplete stats, and timeout issues. A month prior a V2 was in progress to solve these issues. In November 2022 the v2 beta was abandoned. By January 2023 Statcord and the rest of Discordlabs went offline. 

In march 2023 [TomatoCake](https://github.com/DEVTomatoCake) created Disstat with the goal of being Statcord V2, shortly after I forked Disstat working on creating my own version of it. As Disstat got closer to being feature competitive the idea of turning Disstat into the new Statcord seemed achievable. In November 2023 I bought Statcords domains and started transiting Disstat into Statcord.
