In the Deck themes discord server someone was looking for a theme to hide the counter for the amount of family members that have the same game. We both looked around and did not find any way to hide that counter and we both wanted it. I had some free time and knew that it would not be too hard to make, so I decided to make it. A few minutes later I had published it, since then it has reached 56 stars and 9500 downloads.
